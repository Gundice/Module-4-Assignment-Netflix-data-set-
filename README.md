duration: Duration of the content (in minutes or seasons)
listed_in: Genre(s) of the content
description: Brief description of the content
Analysis Overview
The analysis of the Netflix dataset was performed using both Python and R. Here's an overview of the analysis:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Python):

The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.
Missing values in the director, cast, country, date_added, and rating columns were addressed.
Data exploration was conducted to understand the distribution of missing values and perform basic statistical analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (Python):

Descriptive statistics were calculated for numerical columns.
The most watched genres were identified and visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Visualization in R:

The most watched genres visualization generated in Python was integrated into R for further analysis and display.
Repository Structure
